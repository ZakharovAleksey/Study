In this repository I deal with different courses (coursera / stepic) and self-study in fields of computer science, machine learning, e.t.c.

Currently you can find courses about:
1. Algorims in C++ (Sorting, Data Structures, Graph theory).
2. Code of C++ programming course (coursera).
3. [Machine learning](https://github.com/ZakharovAleksey/Study/tree/ml/labeling_data/Machine%20Learning/Yandex_specialization) notes.
4. Notes on Mathematical Statistics (stepic).
5. Introduction to the Numerical methods.
